# movies-info

This is a Netflix Clone created with ReactJS. The API I use to retrieve the data is from TMDB. 

As a movie enthusiast myself, I've always wanted to create an app that bears the exquisite design of Netflix and provide users with a huge collection of movies, sorted by category.
So I decided to make one. Although in this version, user can only access the Youtube video/trailer by clicking on a movie poster, I strive to improve the app so that it will let user watch the movie and inquire the information about the favorite one.
